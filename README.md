Automated Data Pipeline with AWS Glue, Step Functions & EventBridge

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data processing pipeline using AWS Glue, Step Functions, EventBridge, IAM, and S3. The pipeline automates ETL operations, data cataloging, and workflow orchestration for efficient data processing.

🛠️ Technologies Used

AWS Glue: ETL jobs, Data Catalog, and Crawler for data transformation.

AWS Step Functions: Orchestrating and automating workflows.

Amazon EventBridge: Triggering workflows based on scheduled events.

AWS IAM: Managing roles and permissions for secure execution.

Amazon S3: Storing raw and processed data.

🚀 Workflow Architecture

1️⃣ Data Ingestion: Raw data is uploaded to an S3 bucket.
2️⃣ Glue Crawler: Scans the S3 bucket to create/update the Data Catalog.
3️⃣ ETL Job Execution: AWS Glue job processes and transforms data.
4️⃣ Step Functions Orchestration: Automates execution flow (e.g., retry mechanisms, monitoring).
5️⃣ EventBridge Trigger: Schedules the workflow execution at specific intervals.
6️⃣ Data Storage: Transformed data is stored in an S3 bucket for further use.

📌 AWS Glue ETL Job

Extracts raw data from S3.

Transforms data using PySpark (filtering, cleaning, aggregation, etc.).

Loads processed data into another S3 bucket.

📌 AWS Step Functions Workflow

Triggers the AWS Glue Job and manages execution flow.

Includes retries and error handling.

📌 EventBridge Rules

Triggers Step Functions execution based on a schedule (e.g., every 24 hours)

📌 IAM Roles & Policies

Glue needs S3 read/write and Step Functions execution permissions.

Step Functions need Glue job execution permissions.

EventBridge needs Step Functions trigger permissions.

🛠️ How to Deploy?

1️⃣ Create IAM Roles & Policies for Glue, Step Functions, and EventBridge.
2️⃣ Create an AWS Glue ETL Job and upload the script.
3️⃣ Define Glue Crawlers to update the Data Catalog.
4️⃣ Create Step Functions Workflow using JSON definition.
5️⃣ Set up an EventBridge Rule to trigger workflows automatically.
6️⃣ Upload raw data to S3 and trigger the process.

🔹 Next Steps

Optimize ETL performance using AWS Glue partitioning.

Integrate AWS Athena for SQL-based data analysis.

Set up CloudWatch alerts for monitoring execution.
